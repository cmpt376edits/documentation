# About Panda

The Panda is a universal interface for your car.

It helps you to connect a computer directly to your car, allowing you to send and receive signals over Wi-Fi or USB directly to/from the available BUSes available in your vehicle

To put it simply... Panda's allow you to talk to your car over USB and WiFi. 

Panda supports 3 CAN buses, 2 LIN buses, and 1 GMLAN. 

The software for Panda is 100% open source so that programmers \(possibly like yourself\) can easily pull down the code base and see what is going on under the hood.
