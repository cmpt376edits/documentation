This is a universal ball bracket for mounting the Eon Dashcam Kit to any windshield. The Eon Dashcam Devkit is a piece of hardware sold by Comma.ai that runs Chffr, a tool that is helping to train a computer model to drive cars like Humans. Also useful for running the open source Openpilot autonomous driving software package, available on GitHub.
