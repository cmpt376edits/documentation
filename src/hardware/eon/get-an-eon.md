# Get an EON

## Purchasing an EON

The EON is sold exclusively at [**shop.comma.ai**](https://comma.ai/shop/products/eon-dashcam-devkit).

## Build an EON yourself

Well, it is entirely possible to build it yourself but it may end up costing you about the same as the EON.  
I recommend checking out the [**Comma Wiki**](https://community.comma.ai/wiki/index.php/Neo) and the [**Comma Neo Repository**](https://github.com/commaai/neo) for information on the pieces needed to make it work.
