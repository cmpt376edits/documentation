# MDX

As of right now, we're not sure if anyone in the community has Openpilot working on the MDX but we have heard a few bits of chatter around the Slack channel related to MDX.

The MDX has a specific steering type that causes it to not be as easy to work with.

We will keep you posted as we learn more about this.
