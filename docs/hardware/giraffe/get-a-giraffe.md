# Get a Giraffe

## Purchase directly from Comma

There are many ways to acquire a Giraffe but the easiest way by far is to purchase it directly from [shop.comma.ai](https://shop.comma.ai/).  Devices purchased from [shop.comma.ai](https://shop.comma.ai/) are personally built, tested, and shipped directly from the team in San Francisco.  It is the only "official" place to purchase one.

## Purchase from a community member

Another option is to find one that is no longer needed or one that is built by a community member.

You can interact with the community directly by joining the [Comma Slack](https://slack.comma.ai/) channel and getting to know the people there.  Lots of fun times.

## Build it yourself

The last and possibly the least popular of the options is building it yourself.  The Giraffe is open source hardware and the schematics for building your own are posted to the comma GitHub account in the [commaai/neo](https://github.com/commaai/neo/tree/master/giraffe) repository.
